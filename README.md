# Python Menu
A unique python menu built using the `keyboard` and `pygetwindow` libraries, fully modular and customizable. Has active window checking so keyboard inputs are *not* hijacked. This project was made as a quick proof of concept; I will not be fixing errors. Windows Only.

## Features
- Navigation using `Up` & `Down` Arrow Keys
- Selection using `Enter` key
- Easy to customize & well optimised
- Hides console cursor for clean look
- Checks for active window to unsuppress keyboard inputs
